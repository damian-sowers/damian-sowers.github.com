I'm changing my blogging engine from tumblr to octopress because, quite frankly, I am bored with tumblr. Octopress is pretty cool. This blog is being deployed to Github pages, which is great for handling traffic spikes. Many thanks to [Dru Riley](https://twitter.com/DruRly) for pointing me to this nice octopress theme. It's much better than the default, in my opinion.
